## 2026-09-10 — Repository structure adapts BRD Section 75/10 module list to Next.js conventions

**Decision:** Application modules (`/social`, `/advertising`, `/analytics`, `/seo`,
`/creative`, `/reports`, `/approvals`, `/tasks`, `/settings`, etc.) are implemented as
route groups under `src/app/` plus supporting logic under `src/lib/`, rather than as
top-level directories.

**Rationale:** Next.js App Router expects routes under `app/`. Keeping the module
boundary in `lib/` (one subfolder per module) preserves the intent of BRD Section 10
(no separate deployable services, clear module boundaries) without fighting the
framework's routing conventions.

**Alternative considered:** Literal top-level `/social`, `/advertising`, etc.
directories outside `src/`. Rejected — would require custom routing glue with no
benefit over App Router route groups.

## 2026-09-10 — ORM: Prisma

**Decision:** Prisma over Drizzle for the initial schema and all query access.

**Rationale:** BRD Section 9 leaves the choice open but asks it be documented. Prisma
was chosen for: mature migration tooling (`prisma migrate`) that fits the "keep
migrations small and reviewable" rule in `CLAUDE.md`; generated types that pair well
with the tenant-scoped query-helper pattern in `src/lib/db/`; and broad familiarity,
which matters for a small team maintaining this long-term. Drizzle's lighter runtime
and closer-to-SQL feel are real advantages but not decisive at this stage.

**Revisit if:** query performance at scale becomes a bottleneck Prisma's query engine
can't address, or the team wants more direct SQL control.

## 2026-09-10 — Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) + Prisma adapter + custom TOTP MFA + custom RBAC

**Decision:** Self-hosted auth using Auth.js v5 with the Prisma adapter for
sessions/accounts, credentials + magic-link (email) providers, a custom TOTP-based MFA
layer (Auth.js has no built-in MFA), and a custom RBAC schema (`roles`, `permissions`,
`organization_users`, `client_users`) rather than a third-party auth platform.

**Rationale:** BRD Section 9 requires email/password or magic link, OAuth capability,
MFA, session management, and RBAC. A turnkey platform (Clerk, WorkOS, Auth0) would give
MFA and session management out of the box but would fight the custom multi-tenant RBAC
model this product needs (organization-level + client-level permissions, agent
authorization checks reusing the same permission resolution as human users — BRD
Section 31). Keeping auth data in our own Postgres also keeps tenant-isolation testing
(BRD Section 80) inside one system instead of split across our DB and a vendor's.

**Trade-off accepted:** more auth code to write and test ourselves (MFA enrollment,
recovery codes, session revocation) versus a vendor's polished flows. Mitigated by
budgeting explicit test coverage for this in Day 3 (`docs/MVP-CHECKLIST.md`).

**Revisit if:** the team wants SSO/SAML for enterprise clients sooner than Phase 2 —
a vendor platform becomes more attractive at that point.

## 2026-09-10 — Hosting target: proposed, not yet decided

**Status:** Open. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` proposes Vercel + managed Postgres (Neon/
Supabase/RDS) + Upstash Redis + Cloudflare R2 as a default low-ops baseline consistent
with BRD Section 94 ("managed Postgres, managed Redis, managed object storage, secure
hosting"), but this has not been confirmed with the user. See open questions.
