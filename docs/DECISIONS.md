## 2026-09-10 — Session strategy: JWT, not database (Day 3)

**Decision:** `session.strategy = 'jwt'` in the Auth.js config, even though the
Prisma schema has a `Session` table.

**Rationale:** Auth.js's Credentials provider is only supported with JWT sessions —
sign-ins through it aren't persisted to the adapter's `Session` table the way OAuth
sign-ins are, and Auth.js throws a configuration error if you set `strategy:
'database'` while a Credentials provider is registered. The `Session`/
`VerificationToken` models stay in the schema: `VerificationToken` is actively used
by the Nodemailer (magic-link) provider regardless of session strategy, and `Session`
is ready for a future OAuth provider that could use database sessions if one is added.

**Trade-off accepted:** sessions can't be server-side-revoked by deleting a DB row
(they're self-contained encrypted JWTs, valid until expiry). If instant revocation
becomes a requirement (e.g. "kick this user out immediately"), that needs either a
short JWT `maxAge` + a denylist check in the `session` callback, or dropping
Credentials in favor of an OAuth-only + database-session setup.

## 2026-09-10 — No Next.js middleware for route protection (Day 3)

**Decision:** `/dashboard` (and future protected routes) enforce auth via a
`redirect()` check at the top of each server component (see
`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`), not `middleware.ts`.

**Rationale:** Auth.js's documented pattern for edge-compatible middleware requires
splitting the config into an edge-safe partial (no Prisma adapter, no
Node-only `bcryptjs`/`otpauth` in the `authorize` callback) and a full Node.js config
used everywhere else — real complexity for one extra layer of defense, given every
protected page already calls `getCurrentAuthContext()` and redirects. Page-level
guards are enforced today and verified live (unauthenticated `/dashboard` → 307 to
`/sign-in`, confirmed via `curl`).

**Revisit if:** the protected-route surface grows large enough that repeating the
guard per-page becomes error-prone (a forgotten guard is a real vulnerability) — at
that point, either build the edge-safe split properly, or force Next.js middleware
onto the Node.js runtime (stable as of Next 15.2+) so the full config can be reused
without an edge-compatibility rewrite.

## 2026-09-10 — Password hashing: bcryptjs over argon2/native bcrypt

**Decision:** `bcryptjs` (pure JS, cost factor 12) for password hashing.

**Rationale:** No native bindings to compile — one less thing to break across the
range of environments this repo will run in (local dev, CI, various hosting
platforms). Argon2 is the stronger modern choice on paper, but its native dependency
has repeatedly been a source of build friction in Node/serverless environments;
bcrypt's security margin is still adequate for this product's threat model at MVP
stage.

**Revisit if:** a security review specifically calls for Argon2id, or password
hashing throughput becomes a measured bottleneck.

## 2026-09-10 — MFA: `otpauth` (TOTP) with envelope-encrypted secrets; recovery codes not yet persisted

**Decision:** `src/lib/auth/mfa.ts` generates/verifies TOTP codes via `otpauth`
(pure JS). The secret is envelope-encrypted (`src/lib/crypto/envelope.ts`) before
`User.mfaSecret` is ever written — `generateMfaSecret` returns the plaintext only for
one-time QR/manual-entry rendering during enrollment; callers must persist only
`encryptedSecret`. `generateRecoveryCodes` exists but nothing yet stores or verifies
them against a "used" state — no `RecoveryCode` table exists.

**Rationale:** Auth.js has no built-in MFA (see the Day-1 auth decision above); TOTP
is the standard second factor and `otpauth` avoids a native-binding dependency.
Recovery codes were scoped out of Day 3 to keep the slice reviewable — shipping the
core enroll/verify loop now, with recovery-code persistence tracked as a named gap in
`docs/SECURITY.md` rather than silently deferred.

**Revisit before this MFA flow is offered to real users:** add a `RecoveryCode`
table (hashed, single-use) and enrollment/recovery UI.

## 2026-09-10 — Prisma naming: camelCase fields, `@@map` to snake_case tables

**Decision:** `prisma/schema.prisma` uses idiomatic Prisma/TypeScript camelCase field
names (`organizationId`, `clientId`, `createdAt`) rather than the literal snake_case
shown in `docs/BRD-PRD.md`'s illustrative pseudocode. Table names are mapped to
snake_case via `@@map` (e.g. `model AuditEvent` → table `audit_events`) so the
physical schema still reads the way the BRD's examples do.

**Rationale:** BRD Section 32's pseudocode (`organization_id`, `client_id`, ...) is
describing required columns conceptually, not mandating literal casing. camelCase is
the Prisma/TS convention and avoids `@map` boilerplate on every field.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Full Data Model schema implemented (Day 2)

**Decision:** Implemented all 43 tables from `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` as the initial
Prisma migration (`prisma/migrations/20260910092421_init`), applied against a local
Postgres 16 instance and verified with a seed script (org + 4 system roles + starter
permission set + one sample client). `npm run typecheck`, `lint`, `test:unit`, and
`build` all pass against the generated client.

**Notable modeling choices not spelled out in the BRD:**
- `ClientBrain` stores `business` / `audience` / `brand` / `marketing` as validated
  JSON columns (one row per client) rather than seven separate tables, so the Context
  Router can select a single column without loading the whole brain (see
  `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`). Competitors, feedback, brand assets, and policy get real
  tables because they're listed, enforced, or queried individually.
- `ClientPolicy` fields that gate the Approval Engine (`maxDailyAdBudget`,
  `maxBudgetChangePercent`, `autoPublishSocial`, `autoChangeAds`,
  `requireApprovalForCampaignLaunch`) are typed columns, not JSON, plus an `extra`
  JSON overflow field for policy knobs not yet promoted to a column.
- Normalized metric tables (`CampaignMetric`, `SocialMetric`, `SeoMetric`,
  `AnalyticsSnapshot`) each carry `source` / `retrievedAt` / `period` provenance
  columns plus a `raw` JSON column preserving the original provider payload, per BRD
  Section 37/69.
- `AuditEvent` has no update/delete path in application code (append-only by
  construction); a DB-level `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` for the app role is still
  pending a hosting decision on how the app's DB role is provisioned — tracked in
  `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- Auth.js v5's required `Account` / `Session` / `VerificationToken` models are
  included now (Day 2) even though auth itself lands Day 3, so the schema doesn't
  need a second migration just to add them.

**Revisit if:** ClientBrain's JSON sections need per-field query/index performance
that column-level Prisma `select` can't give (e.g. searching within `business.industry`
at scale) — split into typed sub-tables at that point.

## 2026-09-10 — Hosting confirmed: Vercel + managed Postgres + Upstash Redis + Cloudflare R2

**Decision:** User confirmed the proposed default in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Vercel
for the app, a managed Postgres provider (Neon or Supabase, final pick deferred to
Day 2 staging setup), Upstash for Redis/BullMQ, Cloudflare R2 for object storage.

**Status:** Confirmed for staging/production. Local development in this repo uses a
local PostgreSQL 16 instance (see `.env.local`, gitignored) — no hosted resources are
provisioned yet.

## 2026-09-10 — Metricool MCP: ads read/analysis confirmed available; ads write/management not exposed by this MCP

**Decision:** Proceed with Metricool for ads *analysis* (read) in the MVP workflow;
do not plan on Metricool for ads *management* (write) — that capability isn't present
in this MCP server's tool surface at all, independent of account plan.

**Findings (checked live against the connected Metricool MCP in this environment,
account owner `info@tapashub.com`):**
- `getAnalyticsDataByMetrics` / `getAnalyticsAvailableMetrics` support `network`
  values including `googleAds`, `metaAds`, `facebookAds`, `tiktokAds` with a full
  metrics schema (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, CPC, CPM, CTR, ROAS) at
  both account-evolution and per-campaign granularity — this covers the MVP
  "Analyze Client A's ads performance" workflow (BRD Section 19: read-only analysis,
  no modification).
  Note: this metric-schema check does not need write access to an ad
  account - it worked even though no Google Ads account is currently connected
  (see below), so its presence alone doesn't guarantee a given client's data is
  populated. Verify per-client before relying on it for a pilot.
- No campaign/budget/bid write endpoints exist in this Metricool MCP's tool list at
  all (only `createScheduledPost` / `updateScheduledPost` / `sendScheduledPostForReview`
  for **social**, nothing ads-equivalent). This is a property of the MCP server, not
  something an account upgrade would unlock. Matches BRD Section 20's framing of ads
  optimization/execution as later, policy-gated work anyway — not a Day 6 blocker.
- Five brands are connected on this account: **HUGFAB**, **LHO** (Facebook Ads
  connected, account `act_27530167156623376`), **TargetGum**, **undertreegames**
  (Facebook Ads connected, `act_1250233737082703`), **Pepalworks**. None currently
  have a Google Ads account connected in Metricool.
- Implication for the pilot: if the pilot client maps to **LHO** or
  **undertreegames**, Facebook/Meta Ads read analysis is available today. If it needs
  Google Ads specifically, that requires either connecting a Google Ads account to
  the relevant Metricool brand, or a native Google Ads API integration (Phase 2, BRD
  Section 52) for that one channel.

**Revisit if:** ads write/management becomes a real MVP requirement — that's a native
`GoogleAdsProvider`/`MetaAdsProvider` (Phase 2), not something to wait on Metricool for.

## 2026-09-10 — Repository structure adapts BRD Section 75/10 module list to Next.js conventions

**Decision:** Application modules (`/social`, `/advertising`, `/analytics`, `/seo`,
`/creative`, `/reports`, `/approvals`, `/tasks`, `/settings`, etc.) are implemented as
route groups under `src/app/` plus supporting logic under `src/lib/`, rather than as
top-level directories.

**Rationale:** Next.js App Router expects routes under `app/`. Keeping the module
boundary in `lib/` (one subfolder per module) preserves the intent of BRD Section 10
(no separate deployable services, clear module boundaries) without fighting the
framework's routing conventions.

**Alternative considered:** Literal top-level `/social`, `/advertising`, etc.
directories outside `src/`. Rejected — would require custom routing glue with no
benefit over App Router route groups.

---

## 2026-09-10 — ORM: Prisma

**Decision:** Prisma over Drizzle for the initial schema and all query access.

**Rationale:** BRD Section 9 leaves the choice open but asks it be documented. Prisma
was chosen for: mature migration tooling (`prisma migrate`) that fits the "keep
migrations small and reviewable" rule in `CLAUDE.md`; generated types that pair well
with the tenant-scoped query-helper pattern in `src/lib/db/`; and broad familiarity,
which matters for a small team maintaining this long-term. Drizzle's lighter runtime
and closer-to-SQL feel are real advantages but not decisive at this stage.

**Revisit if:** query performance at scale becomes a bottleneck Prisma's query engine
can't address, or the team wants more direct SQL control.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) + Prisma adapter + custom TOTP MFA + custom RBAC

**Decision:** Self-hosted auth using Auth.js v5 with the Prisma adapter for
sessions/accounts, credentials + magic-link (email) providers, a custom TOTP-based MFA
layer (Auth.js has no built-in MFA), and a custom RBAC schema (`roles`, `permissions`,
`organization_users`, `client_users`) rather than a third-party auth platform.

**Rationale:** BRD Section 9 requires email/password or magic link, OAuth capability,
MFA, session management, and RBAC. A turnkey platform (Clerk, WorkOS, Auth0) would give
MFA and session management out of the box but would fight the custom multi-tenant RBAC
model this product needs (organization-level + client-level permissions, agent
authorization checks reusing the same permission resolution as human users — BRD
Section 31). Keeping auth data in our own Postgres also keeps tenant-isolation testing
(BRD Section 80) inside one system instead of split across our DB and a vendor's.

**Trade-off accepted:** more auth code to write and test ourselves (MFA enrollment,
recovery codes, session revocation) versus a vendor's polished flows. Mitigated by
budgeting explicit test coverage for this in Day 3 (`docs/MVP-CHECKLIST.md`).

**Revisit if:** the team wants SSO/SAML for enterprise clients sooner than Phase 2 —
a vendor platform becomes more attractive at that point.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Hosting target: proposed, not yet decided

**Status:** Open. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` proposes Vercel + managed Postgres (Neon/
Supabase/RDS) + Upstash Redis + Cloudflare R2 as a default low-ops baseline consistent
with BRD Section 94 ("managed Postgres, managed Redis, managed object storage, secure
hosting"), but this has not been confirmed with the user. See open questions.
